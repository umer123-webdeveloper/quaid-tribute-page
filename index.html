            <p>
                Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his
                return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
                politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National
                Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career,
                Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the
                All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the
                All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the
                political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
                follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
